What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	The current working directory becomes a repo. A .git meta data file
	is created in the directory. Need to make the first commit still.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a virtualized directory for preparing commits
	from the WD to the Repo.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	The SA allow you to prepare the exact changes you want to include
	in a commit. So you can break multiple changes into multiple commits.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	Branches allow for implementing features while keeping a stable main branch.
	Such as large or experimental changes.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	Diagrams show the sequence of commits and where they branch off.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

	Merging takes the latest commit from two branches and combine their files
	using a merge strategy to produce one commit with the changes made in both
	branches since their last shared commit

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

	Merging automatically saves time and uses a consistent method for deciding
	what goes where in the new commit. Manually merging is time consuming but
	gives more control over the output.
