When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Useful if developing from multiple machines (or with multiple people)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If you are working on a commit intoducing unintended changes can make it
    harder to develop software modularly.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A clone creates a repo from GH to your local machine. A branch 'branches'
    off from a commit to then be modified as a seperate commit. A fork 
    'forks' off from a repo to then be modified as a seperate repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Gives your local commits a point to tie into the GitHub version. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Either shared dropbox or emailing zip projects. Both slower and less
    reliabe. Alos little or no version control mechanisms.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When developing a new feature not entirely ready a seperate branch
    allows developers to work in an isolated enviroment while still
    able to merge changes from master along the way.
